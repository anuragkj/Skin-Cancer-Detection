## Introduction

In this project, I have designed an algorithm that can visually diagnose [melanoma](http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/melanoma), the deadliest form of skin cancer.  In particular, the algorithm distinguish this malignant skin tumor from two types of benign lesions ([nevi](http://missinglink.ucsf.edu/lm/dermatologyglossary/nevus.html) and [seborrheic keratoses](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/bumps-and-growths/seborrheic-keratoses)). 

The data and objective are pulled from the [2017 ISIC Challenge on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection](https://challenge.kitware.com/#challenge/583f126bcad3a51cc66c8d9a).  As part of the challenge, participants were tasked to design an algorithm to diagnose skin lesion images as one of three different skin diseases (melanoma, nevus, or seborrheic keratosis).

## My own algorithm and the resulting scores

Open [my Jupyter Notebook dermatologist-ai.ipynb](dermatologist-ai.ipynb) to see how I trained multiple Convolution Neural Network to classify the three skin diseases and reached a __Mean ROC AUC score of 0.944__ (see ROC curves for melanoma and seborrheic keratosis below). It would have been a __TOP 1__ in the challenge (see scores in [Evaluation](https://github.com/udacity/dermatologist-ai/blob/master/README.md#evaluation)). It's very satisfying for what I wanted to achieve, especially since the __winner's score is 0.911__.  ðŸ˜ƒ

But much more than this score, I learned a lot and sometimes the hard way, and took a lot of fun. ðŸ˜…  
Particularly, I share how I turned my many mistakes while designing the model into positive learning experiences!

## Multi-model statistics

I also found very interesting to make some statisticts on multi-crop / multi-model scores.
A picture is worth a thousand words! Here's the distributions of ROC AUC with respect to number of models:

This is interesting to see that __multi-model gives me â‰ƒ3.25% return over investment__... whereas multi-crop "only" gives â‰ƒ0.6%.

## Getting Started

Click the link below to open and execute my notebook in Google Colab:  

[<img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg">](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sebastienlange/dermatologist-ai/blob/master/dermatologist_ai.ipynb)
  
Ensure GPU is enabled: Edit > Notebook settings or Runtime>Change runtime type and select GPU as Hardware accelerator

In the Notebook's Getting Started, change settings according to your needs:  
![options][image2]

Then press Ctrl+F9 to Execute all cells in the notebook

Be patient, it takes +/-3\* minutes (if download_images=False) or +/- 12 minutes (if download_images=True) to execute all the notebook cells including : 
- 5' to download and 3' to extract default images
- 1' to download and extract additional images
- 1' to download results for all pretrained models
- 1' to build the best team
- 1' to execute all other cells around (1')  
_* timing is of course approximate, and estimated on NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs, which is faster than the older NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU my models were trained on_

Optionally add +/- 16 minutes if you want to skip loading results and force testing, as the very first time it requires to resize all images. And 1 more minute to test DenseNet, and up to 4 minutes for NasNetALarge...

Optionally Add many hours if you want to train your own model... ðŸ˜Š  
Note that my models were trained with NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU.
